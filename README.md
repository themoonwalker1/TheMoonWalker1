### Praneeth Bhandaru

> /'pra.nee.th bun.dare.ru/

I'm a Full Stack Developer, but I particularly enjoy creating web applications and implementing random 
ideas I have through code. I am a member of class of 2023 in <a href="https://tjhsst.fcps.edu">Thomas 
Jefferson High School For Science and Technology</a>, and am considering prusuing a Biotechnology major.
At school, I am a sysadmin, who works on the infrastructure of our school server system, by creating 
web applications, managing various servers and VMs, and executing plans given to us by school admins. 

### ðŸ‘· What I Do on Github

I usually work on our school's private gitlab instance as a sysadmin, but you can see the product of our work at the
<a href="https://github.com/tjcsl">tjcsl</a> organization on github. I mostly work on our IMAP <a href="https://webmail.tjhsst.edu">webmail system</a>,
by creating and handling background services. I also occasionally work on improving our <a href="https://ion.tjhsst.edu">school website</a>, which is 
used by all students to sign up for clubs and receive updates from admins and teachers.
